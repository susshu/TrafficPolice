	       <p align="justify">The job of first-aider is to remove or reduce the problems that hamper healing  such as dirt, infection, movement, etc. Leave the wound undisturbed. Clean the  wound by washing them with running water. If there are splinters, thorns and  pieces of glass inside the wound remove them with a pair of tweezers so as to  avoid infection.</p>

&nbsp;                 </p>
         <p align="justify">In case of a fracture do  not apply direct pressure; instead use a splint, combined with as gentle  pressure bandage. It is safer not to give the patient anything to eat and  drink. This is to protect the patient from vomiting in case he needs anesthesia  and surgery, or has a head injury.</p>

         <strong>In case of an Eye Wound</strong></p>
         <p align="justify">Do not attempt any cleaning or washing of an open eye injury.  Cover the eye with a clean soft cloth; place a stiff covering on top to prevent  any pressure coming on the eye. This is important because the contents can be  squeezed out even through a very small wound.<br>
