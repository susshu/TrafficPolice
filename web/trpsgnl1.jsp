	           <p align="justify">Stop well before the stop line, and don't crowd the intersection. This not only obstructs a clear view of the intersection for other road users, but also make the zebra crossing unsafe for the pedestrians. You are allowed to turn left at the red signal unless there is a sign specifically forbidding you to do so. When turning, yield the right of way to pedestrians and vehicles from other directions. </p>
               <p align="justify"><strong>Wait </strong><br>
               The Amber light gives time to vehicles to clear the road   when the signal is changing from green to red. If caught in the Amber   signal in the middle of a large road crossing do not press your   accelerator in panic but do continue with care.</p>

                 <p align="justify">If first in line, do not go tearing off at the green   signal but pause to see whether vehicles from other directions have cleared the road.</p> <br>
